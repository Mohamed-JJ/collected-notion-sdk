# Collected Notion SDK

## Overview

Welcome to the **Collected Notion SDK**! This open-source project aims to provide developers with a robust set of functionalities to interact with the Notion API. The SDK is designed to simplify the process of managing Notion databases, making it easier to build applications that leverage the power of Notion.

## Project Goals

The initial version of the SDK is set up in both **Python** and **JavaScript**, allowing seamless integration with Notion databases. By providing basic functionalities, we hope to empower developers to create, read, update, and delete pages in their Notion databases effortlessly.

## Background

The inspiration for this project came from a recent assignment where I needed to interact with Notion databases. While learning about this powerful platform that streamlines agile methodologies and information storage, I found that integrating the Notion API was a hassle. Thus, the **Collected Notion SDK** was born!

## Future Vision

We are not stopping here! Our vision is to expand this SDK to support all major programming languages. üåç By doing so, we aim to empower developers across different ecosystems to harness the full potential of Notion.

Looking ahead, we also plan to scale this project further, making it compatible with all of Notion's APIs. This will open up even more possibilities for automation, data management, and productivity enhancements within the Notion ecosystem.

## Contributing

We invite you to check out the project, contribute, and help make this tool even better! Together, we can enhance the way we interact with Notion and streamline workflows for everyone.
